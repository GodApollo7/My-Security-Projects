## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 Vulnerability Assessment Report
Conducted a formal security assessment using the NIST SP 800-30 framework in a simulated business server environment. Evaluated risks to a Linux-based MySQL system and proposed actionable mitigation strategies to enhance data protection and business continuity.

---

### 🐍 IP Allow List Automation with Python
Built a Python script to automate the removal of unauthorized IP addresses from a firewall allow list. Demonstrated file I/O handling, string operations, list processing, and condition-based logic within a remote network environment.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Incident Response Analysis
Investigated a simulated phishing attack involving compromised credentials and unauthorized access to sensitive customer data. Documented a full response cycle including detection, protection, response, and recovery steps aligned with best practices.

---

### 🧠 SQL for Security Investigation
Wrote SQL queries to detect suspicious login activity, identify off-hours access attempts, and filter employee data for internal security audits. Used conditional operators and pattern matching for targeted query results.

---

### 🔒 Linux Access Control Exercise
Explored file and directory permission models on a Linux system. Practiced modifying access rights using `chmod`, managing hidden files, and analyzing ownership settings to ensure proper access control.

---

### ✅ Security Controls & Compliance Checklist
Evaluated a fictional organization against industry compliance standards including PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC. Assessed physical, technical, and administrative controls to identify gaps and document adherence to security best practices.
